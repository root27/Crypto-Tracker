### Crypto Tracker

Crypto Tracker is a simple app that allows you to track the price of cryptocurrencies. It uses the [Coinlore API](https://api.coinlore.net/api/tickers/) to fetch the data. As storage, react native async storage is used. In this app, you can see the price of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. You can also add coins to your favorites section and see the details of each coin. In future, Firebase db will be used to store the favorites section.
